Website

This is the code that powers the website and backend services of ElMedievo.

Install the following services and configure them to run on their default ports:
  * [Ruby 2.6.6](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).
      * Windows: [Ruby Installer](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/releases/tag/RubyInstaller-2.6.6-2) is recommended. Default options should do fine.
      * OS X: [RVM](http://rvm.io) is recommended over the default OS X Ruby. Here's a one-liner: `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`.
  * [MySQL 14.14](https://www.mysql.com/) or later.
  * [NodeJS 10.20.1](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18.04/) or later.
  * [Yarn 1.22.4](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-yarn-on-ubuntu-18-04/) or later. Website was built using rails version 6.0.2.2, so you will require Yarn for webpacker to function properly.
